# Disease prediction
# Abstract
COVID 19 has made diagnosis time and accuracy more and more important, in order to save precious time for the patient and space in the ICU for people who need it, Being able to predict a patient condition or just help on classification 
of a patient symptoms can save precious time and resources to clinical facilities, this is why we pretend to train a clasification machine learning algorithm to predict patient condition.

Using related datasets (drugs review, clinical information, etc), we prentend to test different Machine Learning models to get the best results possible in order to have relevant results.

Main Goal is to be able to detect the presence of one or more diseases using patient related information.

# Research questions
- What is the best model found to solve this problem?
- What are the most relevant features for the selected model?
- How effective is this model?

# Dataset
List the dataset(s) you want to use, and some ideas on how do you expect to get, manage, process and enrich it/them. Show us you've read the docs and some examples, and you've a clear idea on what to expect. Discuss data size and format if relevant.
- Drugs revew datase: https://www.kaggle.com/jessicali9530/kuc-hackathon-winter-2018, we expect to use text reviews related to drugs in order to predict the condition.
- https://www.kaggle.com/iamhungundji/covid19-symptoms-checker, COVID 19 dataset, we could use this to make a classification related to if a patient has covid or not.

# A list of internal milestones up until project milestone 2
- Create a repository for the project
- Creation of a script to obtain all the datasets.
- Review of all datasets
- Election of the most suitable dataset(s)
- Selected dataset(s) cleanance
- If more than one dataset is selected, merge of all the selected datasets
# Questions you need help with '
- Any recomendation to find specifically clinical related datasets
- How are we going to present the project? do we have to show the notebook? or Only explain the results?
